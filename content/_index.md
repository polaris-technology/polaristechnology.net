# FAQ Section
faq:
  enable: true
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  description: "Everything you need to know about Polaris indoor navigation."
  
  items:
    - question: "How does indoor navigation work without GPS?"
      answer: "Polaris uses a combination of technologies including Bluetooth beacons, Wi-Fi triangulation, and visual markers (like QR codes) to provide accurate positioning inside buildings where GPS signals are weak or unavailable."
    
    - question: "How long does implementation take?"
      answer: "Implementation timelines vary based on facility size and complexity. Most single-building deployments are completed within 2-4 weeks, while large campus environments may take 6-12 weeks. Our team handles the entire process from surveying to go-live."
    
    - question: "Is Polaris accessible for users with disabilities?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Accessibility is a core principle of Polaris. We support screen readers, provide high contrast modes, offer accessible route options that avoid stairs, and comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards."
    
    - question: "Can Polaris integrate with our existing systems?"
      answer: "Yes! Polaris offers robust API access and can integrate with building management systems, access control, emergency notification systems, and more. Our Professional and Enterprise plans include custom integration support."
    
    - question: "What happens during an emergency?"
      answer: "Polaris includes emergency egress features that automatically route users to the nearest safe exit. In emergency mode, the system prioritizes safety over convenience and can be controlled by your emergency management team."
    
    - question: "Do users need to download an app?"
      answer: "Polaris works as a progressive web app (PWA), so no app store download is required. Users can access navigation through any modern web browser, and the PWA can be saved to their home screen for easy access."
